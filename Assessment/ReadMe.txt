In this assessment, a simple and effective approach is used to solve the problem efficiently by importing the 'ergast-py'
module after installation to fetch the API data. A function is defined to fetch the season 2023 constructors' IDs and
proceed to retrieve the relative results of each 2023 constructor's races for all the seasons (2023 - 1950), which are then
sorted according to the criteria made for best performance using the race results' points. Eventually, the best performance
of each constructor is stored in a Python data structure (Dictionary), which is then returned by the function to display the
performances.
